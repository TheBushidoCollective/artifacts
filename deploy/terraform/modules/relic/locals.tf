  # for that is granting the deploy service account Secret Manager admin
  # across the project. That is a real privilege increase on a pipeline that
  # currently cannot read or write a single secret, bought to save one gcloud
  # command that runs once. Not worth it.

  # `mail_from`, so a name that does not resolve yet cannot reach a revision.
