# balancer for anything production. It is also the only one of the two that
# leaves room for Cloud Armor later, which matters for a service whose entire
# product is an unauthenticated link a stranger opens.
#
# The sandbox deliberately gets none of this. It keeps its Cloud Run host,
# which is its own registrable domain under the *.run.app public suffix, and
# that separation is the boundary keeping untrusted HTML away from the
