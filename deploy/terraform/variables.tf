    The project-and-region infix in this project's Cloud Run hostnames.

    thebushido-co predates Cloud Run's deterministic
    `{service}-{project_number}` URLs and still issues the legacy
    `{service}-{infix}.a.run.app` form. Both origins have to be known before
    either service is created, because each needs the other's URL and the
    bucket needs the service's for CORS, so the value is supplied rather than
    read back.

    Find it with:
      gcloud run services list --project <id> --format='value(status.url)'

    A `check` block asserts the computed URLs match what Cloud Run actually
    issued, so a wrong value fails the apply instead of deploying a broken
    origin pair.
